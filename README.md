## **Abstract**
**Background:** Lymph node status is a prognostic marker and strongly influences therapeutic decisions in colorectal cancer (CRC).  
**Objectives:** To investigate whether image features extracted by a deep learning model from routine histological slides and/or clinical data can be used to predict CRC lymph node metastasis (LNM).  
**Methods:** Using histological whole slide images (WSIs) of primary tumors of 2431 patients in the DACHS cohort, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict LNM. In parallel, we used clinical data derived from the same cases in logistic regression analyses. Subsequently, the slide-based artificial intelligence predictor (SBAIP) score was included in the regression. WSIs and data from 582 patients of the TCGA cohort were used as external test set.  
**Results:** On the internal test set, the SBAIP achieved an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 71.0%, the clinical classifier achieved an AUROC of 67.0% and a combination of the two classifiers yielded an improvement to 74.1%. Whereas the clinical classifierâ€™s performance remained stable on the TCGA set, performance of the SBAIP dropped to an AUROC of 61.2%. Performance of the clinical classifier depended strongly on the T stage.  
**Conclusion:** Deep learning-based image analysis may help predict LNM of CRC patients using routine histological slides. Combination with clinical data such as T stage might be useful. Strategies to increase performance of the SBAIP on external images should be investigated.
